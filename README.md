## Final Assessment

### Self-Assesment:
During the capstone project, my main role centered around the creation and implementation of the machine learning model we used. This included analysis of the chosen data sources, feature selection, model selection, model training, and model implementation. I wrote much of the final code used in our project, and kept that code updated, clean, and properly functioning throughout. This included making sure our github repository was up-to-date for each deliverable and organized in a concise, clear, and thoughtful manner. 
	
  I supported my teammates in their roles by reviewing code, templates, slides, and dashboards when asked, as well as making sure the ML models were properly interfacing with our source data and storage database. While I did not have a hands-on role in the creation of the dashboard or final presentation slides, I helped review them for accuracy and conciseness, as well as asked clarifying questions about the inclusion of certain items and the purpose they were hoped to convey.
	
  The greatest challenge for me to overcome in this project was my difficulty in trusting others to do a commendable job in their roles. All of my teammates contributed and performed above expectations, but it has always been difficult for me to relinquish control of certain tasks when it comes to projects I care about. Having roles that were separated by technologies and software (i.e. dashboard implementation in Tableau. Presentation in Google Slides, and Database in PostgreSQL) helped me to stay focused on my tasked and allowed me to not worry so much about the other work that was being done. 

### Team Assessment:
	
  Overall, I believe that our team created a successful and enlightening project. We communicated through Slack and Zooom as needed, and everyone was responsive and willing to arrange their schedules to make our group meetings work. Help was always only a simple message away, and was always answered with kindness and insight. The biggest hurdle we faced was a medical emergency in one teammate’s family, but she showed grit and commitment by keeping up with the project as she could, and even calling into our meetings from the hospital waiting room. 
	
  The main strength of our team was the ability of each team member to follow their own thoughts and ideas through their own work, and if that work merited further discussion or inclusion in the project, sharing it with the group. We has multiple key break throughs because one or another member had a question or thought and spent their own time researching how it would impact things before bringing it to the group.

### Project Summary:
	
  Our project had the following goa: Using Covid-19 as a reference, develop a model to prepare for future pandemic outbreaks by directing resources to poor-performing counties based on medical, political, and socio- economic factors. This was accomplished using data from seven different datasets, ranging from US census data, to data on the number of hospital beds in each county, and even survey data on social context and awareness. This data was used to train a machine learning classification module to predict which counties in the United Stated could be classified as in “high risk” of transmissible disease outbreaks, and would therefore be best suited to receive financial and social aid from the government. We chose a Random Forest classification model, and the end model was able accurately identify all of those counties that classified as ‘high risk’ during the Covid-19 pandemic, both when looking at case rates and death rates.
